      The P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in theoretical
      computer science. In informal terms, it asks whether every problem whose
      solution can be quickly verified can also be quickly solved. The informal
      term quickly, used above, means the existence of an algorithm solving the
      task that runs in polynomial time, such that the time to complete the task
      varies as a polynomial function on the size of the input to the algorithm
      (as opposed to, say, exponential time). source: wikipedia
