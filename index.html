      <h2>P vs NP</h2>
      <h3>What is it?</h3>
      <p>
        The P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in theoretical
        computer science. In informal terms, it asks whether every problem whose
        solution can be quickly verified can also be quickly solved. The
        informal term quickly, used above, means the existence of an algorithm
        solving the task that runs in polynomial time, such that the time to
        complete the task varies as a polynomial function on the size of the
        input to the algorithm (as opposed to, say, exponential time).
      </p>
      <p>
        An answer to the P versus NP question would determine whether problems
        that can be verified in polynomial time can also be solved in polynomial
        time. If it turns out that P ≠ NP, which is widely believed, it would
        mean that there are problems in NP that are harder to compute than to
        verify: they could not be solved in polynomial time, but the answer
        could be verified in polynomial time. <br />

      <h3>NP-complete problems</h3>
      <p>
        The easiest way to prove that some new problem is NP-complete is first
        to prove that it is in NP, and then to reduce some known NP-complete
        problem to it. Therefore, it is useful to know a variety of NP-complete
        problems. The list below contains some well-known problems that are
        NP-complete when expressed as decision problems.
