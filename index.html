            <h2>P vs NP</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">
              Roughly speaking, P is a set of relatively easy problems, and NP
              is a set that includes what seem to be very, very hard problems,
              so P = NP would imply that the apparently hard problems actually
              have relatively easy solutions. Here are the details.

            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>
              The P versus NP problem is a major unsolved problem in theoretical
              computer science. In informal terms, it asks whether every problem
              whose solution can be quickly verified can also be quickly solved.
              The informal term quickly, used above, means the existence of an
              algorithm solving the task that runs in polynomial time, such that
              the time to complete the task varies as a polynomial function on
              the size of the input to the algorithm (as opposed to, say,
              exponential time).
            </p>
            <p>
              An answer to the P versus NP question would determine whether
              problems that can be verified in polynomial time can also be
              solved in polynomial time. If it turns out that P ≠ NP, which is
              widely believed, it would mean that there are problems in NP that
              are harder to compute than to verify: they could not be solved in
              polynomial time, but the answer could be verified in polynomial
              time. <br />

            <h3>NP-complete problems</h3>
            <p>
              The easiest way to prove that some new problem is NP-complete is
              first to prove that it is in NP, and then to reduce some known
              NP-complete problem to it. Therefore, it is useful to know a
              variety of NP-complete problems. The list below contains some
              well-known problems that are NP-complete when expressed as
              decision problems.
